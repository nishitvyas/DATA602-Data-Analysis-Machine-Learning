This project is about the housing price in the various cities of India. The dataset is taken from the Kaggle[https://www.kaggle.com/ishandutta/machine-hack-housing-price-prediction] There are 12 columns in total and about 29451 records. There are no missing values in the dataset. The purpose of this project is to know the pattern on how the features(columns) are affecting the house price. The project contains the visualization in the form of text and various graphs, the Python libraries which are used in this notebook are Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn. The first part of this project is Exploratory Data Analysis and the second part will be about the regression model, predicting values and model evaluation. 

/n As conclusion, it is clear that the price of house depends on the location of the property, area of the property, age of property/('RESALE') and number of rooms in that property. Although the construction year wasn't mentioned we couldn't derive the age correctly but taken an assumption that the property which is in the 'RESALE' maybe considerably old.
